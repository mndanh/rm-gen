## Description

The purpose of of this project was to be able to have a ready-made template that I could use when I want to create a README file for future projects. This is to help ensure that the README is not only displayed professionally, but also so that any one who reads it can have an indepth view into the project, and also have a way to contact me with any questions or to collaborate.

## Installation

To install my project, a user will have to make sure they're running inquirer version 8.2.4. You can do this through your terminal by entering npm i@8.2.4.

## Usage

To use my application, you're going to have to open a terminal with all dependencies installed. In that terminal, run node index.js to start with the question prompts. Go through the questions one-by-one and press enter when completed with each. At the end, the README.md will be sent to the folder of the project, where you can copy and paste that into your new projects. Here is a video showing how to use the application: [rm-generator.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xSffXaRhHhu15xNjaPnOTn4tOgU-AA6U/view?usp=drive_link)
